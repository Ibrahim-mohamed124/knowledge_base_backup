<h1>Backup Concepts</h1>
<h2><strong>Portworx Backup components</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Portworx Backup server<ul>
      <li>Built on the Google Remote Procedure Call <mark class="marker-yellow">(gRPC</mark>) framework and offers performance benefits by reducing latency, increasing the performance of CRUD operations</li>
      <li>The server implements the basic <mark class="marker-yellow">CRUD operations on the Portworx Backup objects </mark>to handle the operations of data protection.<ul>
          <li>Backup</li>
          <li>Backup location</li>
          <li>Backup schedule</li>
          <li>Cloud credentials</li>
          <li>Cluster</li>
          <li>Restore</li>
          <li>Roles</li>
          <li>Rules</li>
          <li>Schedule policies</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Portworx Backup Server <mark class="marker-yellow">communicates with Stork to create application-level backups</mark> by creating the <mark class="marker-yellow">backup location and application backups CRDs and Stork monitors these CRDs on each user’s cluster.</mark></li>
      <li>. Portworx Backup Server also monitors the status of application backups and application restores on these clusters.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <h3>What gRPC Does</h3>
  <p><strong>Remote Procedure Calls</strong>: It lets a client call functions on a server as if they were local, even if the server is on another machine.</p>
  <p><strong>Cross-language support</strong>: Works with many languages like Python, Go, Java, C++, and more.</p>
  <p><strong>Efficient communication</strong>: Uses <strong>Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)</strong>, a compact binary format that’s faster and smaller than JSON or XML.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>REST APIs<ul>
      <li>Portworx Backup offers two APIs, <mark class="marker-yellow">backup API and backend API</mark>.<ul>
          <li>Portworx Backup backend API to create, manage and assign roles to the user.</li>
          <li>Portworx Backup API to create, delete, schedule, and restore backups.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Portworx Central<ul>
      <li>Facilitate a quick installation with spec generator to deploy Portworx Backup onto the clusters.&nbsp;</li>
      <li><strong>Portworx Central on-premises</strong> is a graphical web console that allows you to monitor and manage your Portworx clusters.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Backup cluster<ul>
      <li>The target cluster do deploy applications</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Application clusters<ul>
      <li>The source cluster for the applications</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Stork<ul>
      <li>a cloud native storage operator runtime scheduler plugin.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Datastore<ul>
      <li>where the Portworx Backup stores objects related to the cluster such as backup location, schedule policies, backup, restore, and backup schedules</li>
      <li>MongoDB is the datastore from the 2.0.0 version to store the metadata about the cluster objects</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Keycloak<ul>
      <li>To validate and authorize tokens that are used for the API calls.</li>
      <li>Keycloak component can be configured to add compatible external OIDC providers either during installation or post-installation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cloud storage<ul>
      <li>backup target to provide storage for the backups</li>
      <li>a cloud-based S3 compliant object store backup location or cloud-based NFS backup location in Portworx Backup</li>
      <li>Portworx Backup supports object lock for cloud-based S3 compliant object store backup locations to secure your critical data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>You can add cloud-based object store or<mark class="marker-yellow"> block store backup location</mark> in Portworx Backup and backup your data on those cloud-based targets.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>NFS server<ul>
      <li>Portworx Backup's Stork component communicates directly with NFS server through PVCs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
