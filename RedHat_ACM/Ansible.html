<h3>Benefits of Integrating Ansible with RHACM</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consistency and standardization:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Eliminate configuration drift: Manually applying policies across many clusters is prone to errors and inconsistencies. Ansible applies the exact same policy definitions uniformly.&nbsp;<ul>
          <li><mark class="marker-yellow">RHACM detects</mark> that a cluster is<mark class="marker-yellow"> missing a required</mark> logging agent.</li>
          <li>It<mark class="marker-yellow"> triggers an Ansible job via Automation Platform</mark>.</li>
          <li>Ansible installs and configures the agent uniformly across all affected clusters.</li>
          <li><mark class="marker-yellow">RHACM verifies compliance post-remediation</mark>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Repeatable, standardized workflows: <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-an-ansible-playbook">Ansible Playbooks</a> allow you to define <mark class="marker-yellow">repeatable, standardized workflows for policy deployment, updates, and enforcement. </mark>This promotes best practices and reduces reliance on individual knowledge.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>RHACM Supports auto-remediation</strong> — <i>but only for Kubernetes-native resources</i> (e.g., enforcing a <code>ConfigMap</code>, <code>Namespace</code>, or <code>PodSecurityPolicy</code>).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Enhanced governance and compliance: </strong>Advanced Cluster Management policies are <mark class="marker-yellow">declaratively defined</mark>, and Ansible complements this by <mark class="marker-yellow">consistently applying these declarative states</mark>. If a cluster deviates from the desired policy, you can use Ansible to remediate the issue.</li>
  <li><strong>Auditing and reporting: </strong>You can use Ansible to enforce policies and<mark class="marker-yellow"> gather compliance data from clusters</mark>, aiding in auditing and generating reports on your security posture. This provides better visibility and control.</li>
</ul>
